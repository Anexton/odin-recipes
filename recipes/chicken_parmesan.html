    <h3>How to Make the Best Chicken Paramesan</h3>

    <p>Every Italian home cook should know how to 
    make classic Chicken Parmesan (Parmigiano). 
    It requires pounding the chicken breasts to a thin and
    even size, and breading them with traditional flour,
    egg wash, and seasoned breadcrumbs. Use whole-milk 
    mozzarella if you can for that extra buttery flavor.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 cup flour</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>3 tb cream</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>minced flat leaf parsley</li>
        <li>breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>Marinara Sauce</li>
        <li>grated/shredded whole milk mozzarella</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch.</li>
        <li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides</li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</li>
        <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
